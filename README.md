# ABOUT SCYTHESTATION
Scythestation is a mod that lets you do things to gameworlds, yourself, your humor, and prob the game in general. I made this mod to have atleast some clientish features back for fun but then that feeling wore off and got boring again, so heres the client in its full (full)

This client went EOL in 1/10/23 On V2.0 (useable until then / u can revive it if u want to idc atleast take the credits though)
